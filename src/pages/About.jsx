      <h2>History of pizza</h2>
      <p>
        The history of pizza begins in antiquity, as various ancient cultures
        produced flatbreads with several toppings. A precursor of pizza was
        probably the focaccia, a flatbread known to the Romans as panis
        focacius, to which toppings were then added. Modern pizza evolved from
        similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, between the 16th and mid-18th
        century. The word pizza was first documented in AD 997 in Gaeta and
        successively in different parts of Central and Southern Italy. Pizza was
        mainly eaten in Italy and by emigrants from there. This changed after
        World War II when Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza
        along with other Italian foods.

        Foods similar to pizza have been made since antiquity. Records of
        pizza-like foods can be found throughout ancient history. In the 6th
        century BC, Persian soldiers serving under Darius the Great baked
        flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of their battle shields. In
        Ancient Greece, citizens made a flatbread called plakous (πλακοῦς, gen.
        πλακοῦντος – plakountos) which was flavored with toppings like herbs,
        onion, cheese and garlic. An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs
        in the Aeneid (c. 19 BC), when Celaeno, the Harpy queen, foretells that
        the Trojans would not find peace until they were forced by hunger to eat
        their tables (Book III). In Book VII, Aeneas and his men are served a
        meal that includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped with cooked
        vegetables. When they eat the bread, they realize that these are the
        "tables" prophesied by Celaeno.
